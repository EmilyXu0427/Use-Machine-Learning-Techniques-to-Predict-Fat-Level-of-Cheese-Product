<h2/>Purpose and original interest</h2>
</div>
I am always curious if I can apply machine learning in food industry to make useful prediction. In this project, I have done a exploratory data analysis on the cheese dataset from goveronment resource. After data analysis, feature selection and transformation, I fit different machine learning models on this dataset, and carry out hyparameter tuning and evaluate the final model.

<h2/>Work done</h2>
</div>

✅ Load data, data spliting (train and test data) <br>
✅ Basic exploratory data analysis and visualization on test data <br>
✅ Select useful features and drop useless columns <br>
✅ Build baseline model <br>
✅ Different feature columns imputation and transformation <br>
✅ Build pipeline for columns (different feature columns) imputation and transformation and fit different models/estimators <br>
✅ Hyperparameters tuning with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV<br>
✅ Model evaluation with different metrics <br>
✅ Model selection and evaluate with test data <br>
